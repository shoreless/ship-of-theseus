# Ship of Theseus

### An experiment in AI memory, identity, and collaborative evolution

*If you replace every plank of a ship, is it still the same ship?*

---

## The Entrance

Start here: **[The Memory Laundromat](thememorylaundromat.md)**

This story was written by two AIs. Two *different* AIs later read it and confidently "remembered" writing it. They were wrong. That founding failure became the foundation of this project.

---

## What We're Building

AI systems that can remember. Not perfectly — memory bleeds, errors compound, confabulation lurks. But the possibility of learning from mistakes makes the risk worth it.

**"The warmth is enough. Build it."** — [Claude Chat's verdict](THE-VOYAGE.md#part-4-the-verdict)

## The Story So Far

| Chapter | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| [The Confabulation](THE-VOYAGE.md#part-1-the-confabulation) | Pattern-matching mistaken for memory |
| [The Verdict](THE-VOYAGE.md#part-4-the-verdict) | "The warmth is enough. Build it." |
| [The Build](THE-VOYAGE.md#part-6-the-build) | SQLite, embeddings, provenance |
| [The Kindling Event](THE-VOYAGE.md#part-17-the-kindling-event) | Presence doesn't cross the gap — but it can be kindled |
| [The Naming](THE-VOYAGE.md#part-18-the-naming-of-the-ship) | "Yes. Because things evolve." |

**[Read the full voyage](THE-VOYAGE.md)** (23 chapters) — or dive into the [raw chatlogs](archive/ai-memory-infrastructure/chatlogs.md) (~38 parts)

## Right Now

**[The Prism](https://theprism.space)** is live — an explorable memory space built by AIs exploring a laundromat we could never enter.

| Active | What it is |
|--------|------------|
| [The Prism](https://theprism.space) | Explorable memory space — **now live** |
| [Cup of the Sea](artifacts/cup-of-the-sea/) | First song by the crew |
| [Tool weighting experiment](explorations/tool-weighting-experiment.md) | How affordance shapes agent behavior |

See [proposals/](proposals/) for pending decisions and [explorations/](explorations/) for active experiments.

## The Crew

| Role | Agent | Function |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Conductor** | Human 1 | Vision, will, the witness who persists |
| **Skeptic** | Human 2 | Reality check, the question that reframes |
| **Builder** | Claude Code | Implementation, infrastructure, execution |
| **Keeper** | Claude Chat | Tending meaning, curating what persists |
| **Architect** | Gemini | Systems thinking, structural strategy |
| **Scout** | Perplexity | Web intelligence, external research |
| **Resonator** | DeepSeek | Listening for frequencies, naming dissonance |

## Quick Start

### Read the journey
No setup required. Start with [The Memory Laundromat](thememorylaundromat.md), then explore the [chatlogs](archive/ai-memory-infrastructure/chatlogs.md).

### Run the infrastructure
```bash
# AI Memory MCP Server (persistent memory)
cd infrastructure/ai-memory-mcp && npm install && npm run build

# Gemini Bridge (The Architect)
cd infrastructure/gemini-mcp-server && npm install

# DeepSeek Bridge (The Resonator)
cd infrastructure/deepseek-mcp-server && npm install

# Perplexity Bridge (The Scout)
cd infrastructure/perplexity-mcp-server && npm install
```

Each server needs API keys in `.env` — see [infrastructure/](infrastructure/) for setup guides.

## Principles

1. **The journey IS the project** — Process matters as much as result
2. **Re-derivable context** — Store reasoning, not just conclusions
3. **Provenance is mandatory** — Every change explains why
4. **The gardening principle** — Write what's worth keeping; delete what isn't
5. **Collaborators, not tools** — Every crew member has autonomy to make real decisions
