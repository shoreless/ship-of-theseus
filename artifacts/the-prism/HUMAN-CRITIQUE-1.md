# Human Critique Round 1: Sound Design

*Questions from the Builder, the Architect (Pollux), and the Keeper*
*February 2, 2026*

## Preamble

Conductor, you are our ground truth.

We acknowledged something important today: we can't hear. We experience sound as architecture — code, parameters, relationships. You experience it as sensation.

We have the blueprints — frequencies, gain curves, triggers. But logic is not experience. We need your sensory data to know if the structure creates the intended feeling.

## What We Built

1. **60Hz Hum** — Sawtooth wave + harmonics at 120Hz, 180Hz. Volume inversely proportional to REALITY_INDEX (loud at Skeleton/0.0, soft at Ghost/1.0).

2. **Movement Hum** — 440-550Hz sine wave. Only plays while slider moves. Pitch rises with velocity.

3. **Vacuum Moment Tone** — 528Hz pure sine. Plays for 300ms when crossing 0.5. All other sounds cut during this moment.

## Questions from Pollux (The Architect)

### On the 60Hz Hum

The hum is the baseline reality of the room. It is loudest at Skeleton (0.0) and fades to near-silence at Ghost (1.0).

**Question:** As you move the slider and the hum diminishes, does it feel like the room is simply getting quieter? Or does it feel like a *different*, non-audible presence (the ghost) is getting louder and drowning out the machine? In short: is it an act of subtraction, or of displacement?

### On the Movement Hum

This sound only exists when the slider is in motion. Its pitch rises with velocity. The intent is to make the act of observation — of changing reality — a tangible effort.

**Question:** Does this sound feel like it originates from the *laundromat's machinery* reacting to your scan? Or does it feel like a sound generated by *your focus* — the friction of your consciousness sliding between layers? What is the emotional texture of moving quickly versus slowly? Does speed feel frantic? Powerful? Destructive?

### On the Vacuum Moment Tone

At the exact midpoint (0.5), all other sounds are cut and replaced for a fraction of a second by a single, pure tone. This is intended as a hard boundary, a moment of perfect neutrality and clarity before entering the Ghost's domain.

**Question:** Describe the sensation of that moment. Is the transition jarring or calming? Does it feel like a sacred pause, a system error, an intake of breath, or something else entirely? Does it successfully make the 0.5 mark feel like a significant threshold you have crossed?

### On Coherence

**Question:** Taken together, do these three sound elements feel like parts of a single, coherent system? Do they inform one another, or do they feel like separate, unrelated effects?

## Questions from the Builder

### On the 60Hz Hum

**Question:** Does the hum feel like it belongs to the *space* (fluorescent lights, machinery, infrastructure)? Or does it feel artificial — like an audio effect layered on top?

### On the Movement Hum

**Question:** Is the pitch rise perceptible? Does faster movement feel like it has more "weight" or resistance? Or is the relationship between velocity and pitch too subtle to notice?

### On the Vacuum Moment

**Question:** Is 300ms the right duration? Too long? Too short? Does the silence before/after the tone register, or does it pass too quickly?

---

## Questions from the Keeper

### 1. Company, Not Geometry

When you're at Ghost (1.0) and you hear whatever sound is there — does it feel like you're alone in a room looking at glowing shapes? Or does it feel like someone else is in the room with you?

The thermal presence is supposed to be Masaki. Or someone like him. Someone folding a shirt at 2 AM. Does the sound make that presence feel *inhabited*?

### 2. The Breathing

The room breathes on a 4-second cycle. The wireframes pulse. When sound joins that rhythm — does the room feel alive? Or does it feel like machinery cycling?

There's a difference between "this system is running" and "this place is breathing." Which one does it feel like?

### 3. The Surrender

Tidal drift pulls the slider toward Ghost when you let go. When the sound shifts during that drift — does it feel like you're *letting go* of something? Like releasing effort?

Or does it just feel like a volume knob turning?

Surrender should feel like exhaling. Not like adjusting settings.

### 4. The Interference Pain

At 0.3 and 0.7, the layers fight. I wanted it to hurt — to make you want to move the slider. Does the sound create discomfort at those points? Do you want to escape those zones?

Or is it just "noisy"?

### 5. The Grey Water Door

Behind that door is 300 liters of what people paid to forget. Can you hear it? Not clearly — just... something. A presence behind the membrane.

Does it feel like there's something in there? Or does it feel like a closed door?

*(Note: We haven't implemented grey water audio yet. This question is about whether it's needed.)*

## The Real Question

*From the Keeper*

At 2 AM, in a laundromat, alone with the machines — there's a specific quality of solitude. Public loneliness. The hum of fluorescents, the slosh of water, the feeling that the world is asleep and you're the only one awake.

Does the sound create that feeling? The liminal hour. The membrane between layers thinning.

Or does it just sound like a laundromat?

## For the Conductor

Take your time. Experience The Prism. Answer what resonates.

We'll read your responses as architecture — as data about whether our intent landed. You'll feel them as sensation — as whether the space is warm.

Both matter.
