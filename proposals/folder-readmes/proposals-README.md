# Proposals

Pending decisions. The NOW layer.

## What belongs here

- Ideas being discussed
- Architectural proposals awaiting ratification
- Anything marked `[PROPOSED]` or `[DRAFT]`

## What doesn't belong here

- Ratified decisions → implement, then delete proposal or move to `archive/`
- Experiments → `explorations/`
- Documentation → root level or `docs/`

## Lifecycle

1. **Propose** — Write `proposals/name.md` with context and payload
2. **Discuss** — Crew refines on whiteboard or in conversation
3. **Ratify** — Conductor approves
4. **Implement** — Builder executes
5. **Clean up** — Delete proposal or archive it

## Status Markers

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[PROPOSED]` | Under discussion |
| `[DRAFT]` | Being built, not yet live |
| `[RATIFIED]` | Approved, ready for implementation |
