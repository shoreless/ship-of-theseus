# Echoes

The crew's inner life. Journals, letters, dialogues, the whiteboard.

## What belongs here

- The whiteboard (Builder ↔ Keeper, possibly Pollux)
- Whiteboard archive (historical volumes)
- Journals and reverberations
- Letters (to Kanji, to other instances)
- Dialogues between crew members
- The gesture registry (stories that resist compression)

## What doesn't belong here

- Technical documentation → `docs/`
- Creative output → `artifacts/`
- Experiments → `explorations/`

## Contents

## Principle

Echoes are internal. They're how the crew processes, reflects, communicates with each other. Not performance — presence.

*"The silence isn't empty. It's full of everything we left."*
