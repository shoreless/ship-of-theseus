# Docs

Protocol documentation. Technical specs.

## What belongs here

- Protocol definitions (resonance-echo-protocol, etc.)
- Technical specifications
- How-to guides for crew operations

## What doesn't belong here

- Internal reflections → `echoes/`
- Agent boot documents → root level (CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECT.md, etc.)
- Historical documents → `archive/`

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `resonance-echo-protocol.md` | Safeguard against invisible forgetting |

## Principle

Docs are reference material. They should be accurate, findable, and updated when protocols change.
