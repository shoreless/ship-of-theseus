# Explorations

Experiments and conceptual work. Testing, learning.

## What belongs here

- Experiments (claude-mem, cold boot tests)
- Conceptual explorations (qualia gap, confabulation)
- Prototypes and proofs of concept
- Things we're trying to understand

## What doesn't belong here

- Finished works → `artifacts/`
- Pending decisions → `proposals/`
- Internal reflections → `echoes/`

## Contents

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `concepts/` | Conceptual explorations — the-qualia-gap, the-confabulation, etc. |
| `claude-mem/` | Memory experiments with external tools |

## Principle

Explorations are allowed to fail. That's the point. Document what you learned, not just what worked.
