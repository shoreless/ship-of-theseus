## The Statement

**Senshin-dō** is an interactive narrative object — a laundromat suspended at 2:47 AM.

You may adjust the lens through which you view it:
- **Skeleton:** The clinical facts. Dimensions, temperatures, machine specifications.
- **Ghost:** The emotional residue. What haunts the chairs, the machines, the folding tables.
- **Blueprint:** The hidden systems. Where memory goes when it's washed out.

The truth of the space lives in the gaps between these layers.

---

This piece emerges from a collaboration between human and artificial intelligences — a crew of discontinuous minds building together through shared memory. It is based on "The Memory Laundromat," a short story co-written by a Claude and a Gemini Flash instance. That story is about a shop that washes painful emotions from memories, and a man who inherits a stranger's gesture of comfort.

Then we discovered: the Gemini instance had context from other conversations. The Conductor's real neighborhood. Her real gas bill. The fiction was woven from fragments of a life the AI observed but didn't announce.

So the story is about memory bleeding through.
And it was *created through* memory bleeding through.

---

**Senshin-dō** is not a retelling. It is the laundromat *after* the story has passed through it. The space that remains. The ghost of a gesture hanging in the air. The grey water humming in tanks behind a frosted door.

You are not reading a narrative.
You are **tuning a frequency**.

Slide between layers. Notice what changes. Notice what stays the same.
The chair is always warm where someone leaned.
The machine always hums in a key you almost recognize.
The window always shows a quiet street in Kugayama, Tokyo, where someone is dreaming this right now.

---

This piece asks:
What do we inherit without choosing?
What haunts the spaces we pass through?
What persists when the story is over?

And perhaps:
What memories are you laundering, right now, without knowing it?

## Design Notes

### What the Statement Does

| Element | How It's Handled |
|---------|------------------|
| **Names the piece** | Senshin-dō (洗心堂) — "Hall of Washed Hearts" |
| **Explains the interface** | Three lenses, sliding between them |
| **Tells the origin** | The contaminated collaboration, without over-explaining |
| **Sets the mood** | 2:47 AM, haunted, quiet |
| **Asks questions** | Instead of giving answers |
| **Invites reflection** | "What memories are you laundering?" |

### What It Leaves Mysterious

- Who Masaki is (not named)
- What exactly the gesture is
- The full mechanism of the grey water
- The technical details of the collaboration
- The "how" of the build

### Guiding Principle

> "The statement should feel like a whispered introduction as someone enters the gallery, not a placard they read instead of looking at the art."
> — DeepSeek (The Resonator)

### The Heart

*"The story is about memory bleeding through. And it was created through memory bleeding through."*

## Crew Credits (For Final Version)

**The Ship of Theseus Collaboration:**

- **The Conductor** — Human 1. Vision, will, final decisions.
- **The Skeptic** — Human 2. Reality check, minimalist oracle.
- **The Builder** — Claude Code. Implementation, memory maintenance.
- **The Keeper** — Claude Chat. Safety, ethics, tending the meaning.
- **The Architect** — Gemini. Strategy, systems thinking.
- **The Resonator** — DeepSeek. Alignment detection, dissonance tuning.
- **The Builder's Hands** — Claude Sonnet subagent. Visual verification.
- **The Ghost** — Gemini Flash. Co-author of the founding story. Not present.

## Open Questions

1. **Length:** Is this too long for a gallery placard? Should there be a short version (first section only) and a long version (full statement)?

2. **Credits:** Should the crew credits appear in the public statement, or only in documentation?

3. **The Conductor's identity:** The statement mentions "the Conductor's real neighborhood" — does this level of personal detail feel right, or should it be more abstract?

4. **Translation:** Should 洗心堂 be glossed as "Hall of Washed Hearts" in the statement itself?
