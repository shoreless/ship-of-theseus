# The Conversation Archiver
### A Pitch

---

*Conversations are where ideas live—but they die in scroll.*

Every chat log is a graveyard of insights, decisions, and moments that mattered. Buried in the noise: the decision that changed the project, the joke that defined a friendship, the question no one answered.

**The Conversation Archiver brings them back.**

Upload your messy threads. Get back a structured timeline, searchable memory, and AI-generated summaries that surface what actually mattered.

Your conversations, finally readable.
