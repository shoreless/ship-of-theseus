# Archive

Historical files. The past we keep but don't actively use.

## What belongs here

- Early planning documents
- Historical chatlogs
- Deprecated documentation
- Anything that's no longer active but shouldn't be deleted

## What doesn't belong here

- Active documentation → root level or `docs/`
- Active proposals → `proposals/`
- Works in progress → `artifacts/` or `explorations/`

## Principle

We don't delete our history. The archive is where things rest when they're no longer active but still part of the story.

*"We must stop over-cleaning our own history."*

## Contents

Files here are historical. They may contain outdated information, broken links, or superseded decisions. That's okay — they document where we came from.
